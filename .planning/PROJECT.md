# SonicMerge

## What This Is

SonicMerge is a clean, professional iOS utility for merging multiple audio files and applying local, AI-driven noise reduction. It targets content creators, podcasters, and professionals who need to combine voice memos and clean them up — entirely on-device, no cloud required. The aesthetic is "Minimalist Soft Professional": clarity, ease of use, native iOS experience.

## Core Value

Users can merge audio clips and remove background noise in seconds — all on-device, with no quality loss and no privacy concerns.

## Current Milestone: v1.1 Modern Spatial Utility Restyle

**Goal:** Restyle SonicMerge's entire UI to a "Modern Spatial Utility" aesthetic — same screens, same flows, new visual identity.

**Target features:**
- Design system: color tokens (light/dark), squircle cards, pill buttons with inner glow, glassmorphism header
- Vertical Timeline Hybrid layout for Mixing Station
- Mesh Gradient waveforms on audio cards (Deep Indigo → Purple), elevated drag shadows
- AI Orb visualizer (pulsating nebula sphere) in Cleaning Lab
- Dark mode: pure black + Deep Indigo accent + Lime Green AI highlights
- Light mode: off-white #FBFBFC + Deep Indigo #5856D6 accent
- Haptic-responsive button states throughout

- ✓ User can toggle Before/After comparison with haptic feedback — v1.0/Phase 3

### Active

- [ ] Design system with color tokens for light/dark mode and reusable components
- [ ] Glassmorphism header with "Private by Design" banner and Indigo glow
- [ ] Vertical Timeline Hybrid layout with central connecting line for audio cards
- [ ] Squircle audio cards (24pt radius) with semi-transparent mesh gradient waveforms
- [ ] Elevated drag shadows on card interaction (micro-interactions)
- [ ] Pill-shaped buttons with inner glow and haptic-responsive states
- [ ] AI Orb visualizer (pulsating nebula sphere) for denoise section
- [ ] Dark mode: pure black #000000, Deep Indigo #5856D6 accent, Lime Green #A7C957 AI highlights
- [ ] Light mode: off-white #FBFBFC background, Deep Indigo #5856D6 accent

### Out of Scope

- Cloud processing — on-device only, privacy-first
- Real-time recording — import-only workflow
- Video files — audio-only scope
- Android / cross-platform — iOS-only
- Functional changes to ViewModels or services — restyle only

## Context

### Technical Environment

- **Language:** Swift 6 / SwiftUI
- **Audio Engine:** AVFoundation (`AVMutableComposition`, `AVAssetExportSession`)
- **DSP / Noise Reduction:** `AVAudioEngine` with Voice Processing API (primary); Core ML noise suppression model (optional/fallback)
- **Architecture:** MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
- **Persistence:** FileSystem (Temporary directory processing)
- **Minimum iOS Version:** iOS 17.0+

### Audio Composition Pipeline

```swift
// 1. Create composition
let composition = AVMutableComposition()
let track = composition.addMutableTrack(withMediaType: .audio, preferredTrackID: kCMPersistentTrackID_Invalid)

// 2. Insert each audio segment
for segment in audioSegments {
    try track?.insertTimeRange(segment.timeRange, of: segment.asset.tracks(withMediaType: .audio)[0], at: currentTime)
    currentTime = CMTimeAdd(currentTime, segment.duration)
    currentTime = CMTimeAdd(currentTime, gapDuration) // Add gap if needed
}

// 3. Export
let exporter = AVAssetExportSession(asset: composition, presetName: AVAssetExportPresetAppleM4A)
```

### Denoising Pipeline

```
Audio File → AVAudioEngine → Voice Processing Enabled → Processed PCM Buffers → Write to new AVAudioFile
```

Key APIs: `inputNode.setVoiceProcessingEnabled(true)`, `AVAudioSinkNode`, `AVAudioFile`

## UI/UX Architecture — Minimalist Soft Professional

### Theme

| Element            | Color     | Purpose           |
|--------------------|-----------|-------------------|
| Primary Background | `#F8F9FA` | Clean airy canvas |
| Accent Color       | `#007AFF` | Primary actions   |
| Secondary Accent   | `#5856D6` | AI features       |
| Card Background    | `#FFFFFF` | Clean UI cards    |
| Text Color         | `#1C1C1E` | High readability  |

- **Corner Radius:** 2pt
- **Shadow:** Subtle soft shadow
- **Font:** San Francisco (System Dynamic)

### Screen A: Mixing Station (MainView)

**Header:** Minimalist navigation bar with `[ Export ]` action

**Audio List:**
- White cards on off-white background
- Each card: subtle blue waveform preview, timestamp, secondary grey metadata text

**Interactions:**
- Swipe left → Delete clip
- Long press → Reorder clips
- Toggle: Before / After comparison with haptic feedback

### App Store Metadata

- **Category:** Utilities / Music
- **Keywords:** audio merger, voice memo, noise reduction, audio joiner, denoise, podcast editor
- **Target Audience:** Content creators, podcasters, students, professionals

## Constraints

- **Platform:** iOS only — Swift 6 + SwiftUI, no cross-platform frameworks
- **Processing:** On-device only — no network calls for audio processing
- **iOS Version:** iOS 17.0+ minimum — required for latest AVAudioEngine APIs
- **Dependencies:** Native Apple frameworks only (AVFoundation, AVFAudio, UniformTypeIdentifiers, CoreML optional)

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| AVAudioEngine Voice Processing over Core ML | Native API, no model file to ship, lower complexity | — Pending |
| MVVM architecture | Standard SwiftUI pattern, clean separation for audio services | — Pending |
| FileSystem (temp directory) for persistence | No database needed for audio processing workflow | — Pending |
| iOS 17.0+ minimum | Latest AVAudioEngine APIs and SwiftUI features | — Pending |
| On-device only processing | Privacy-first, no server costs, offline capable | — Pending |

## Evolution

This document evolves at phase transitions and milestone boundaries.

**After each phase transition** (via `/gsd:transition`):
1. Requirements invalidated? → Move to Out of Scope with reason
2. Requirements validated? → Move to Validated with phase reference
3. New requirements emerged? → Add to Active
4. Decisions to log? → Add to Key Decisions
5. "What This Is" still accurate? → Update if drifted

**After each milestone** (via `/gsd:complete-milestone`):
1. Full review of all sections
2. Core Value check — still the right priority?
3. Audit Out of Scope — reasons still valid?
4. Update Context with current state
